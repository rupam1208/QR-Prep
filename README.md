# From black-holes to black-scholes

This project implements basic financial formulas for computing payoffs in different derrivative trades e.g. long/short forward contract, long/short option call/put etc:

- Payoff in forward contract
- Payoffs in option trades
- Plot functions for payoffs in different strategies
- Interactive inputs via Jupyter widgets

## Folder Structure

- `payoff.ipynb`: Main analysis and interactive plots, the plots are also implemented through the function plot_payoff()
- `utils/finance_tools.py`: Modularized reusable functions for payoffs for derrivative contracts

## Requirements

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```
