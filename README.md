# From QGP to QR: A High-Energy Leap into High-Stakes Finance

*The trajectory of a high-energy phenomenologist into the world of quant research*

This repository contains a structured 12-month plan for preparing for Quant Researcher roles. It follows a Phase-based layout and covers theory, Python projects, and probability concepts.

## Structure

- `phase1_foundations/`: Forwards, options, arbitrage, hedging
- `phase2_models/`: Pricing models, Greeks, BSM
- `phase3_projects/`: Monte Carlo, PCA, strategy backtesting
- `phase4_interviews/`: Puzzles, mock coding rounds
- `notes/`: Cross-book unified notes and notation
- `utils/`: Reusable Python modules for plotting/pricing

## Getting Started

1. Install requirements
2. Browse notebooks by phase
3. Use `notes/` as a conceptual anchor
